NVim Configuration
==================

Overview
--------

This repository contains a work-in-progress configuration set for 
![NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) ![nightly version](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly).

I started looking into NeoVim as a light-weight yet feature-rich replacement 
for ![VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and other full-featured IDEs.

At the time of creating this configuration, the nightly version of NeoVim was 
needed to use the ![nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) plugin which enables 
the integration into NeoVim's built-in Language Server Client and interacts 
with various ![Language Server Implementations](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md).

Besides the LSP setup, the configuration also utilizes some plugins to
augment and enhance the software development experience, while other plugins 
have been included for experimentation purposes.
